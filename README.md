# COVID-19-Movie-Theatre-Seating
Inspired by the knights tour problem (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-knights-tour-problem-backtracking-1/), 
I created a program to create the all possible safe (takes input for distance between each row and seat) seating arrangements in a movie theatre. 
Along with each possibility comes a score, and the most optimal arrangement is thus given.
